    <h1> My Poem </h1>
    
    <h2> Baking </h2>
    
    <p>In the kitchen, a dance of delight,
Where ingredients blend, embracing the light.
Flour and sugar, a sweet symphony,
Creating magic, for all to see.<br><br>

Mixing bowls spin, like partners in grace,
As memories form, in this sacred space.
Butter and eggs, harmoniously entwined,
Whispering secrets, recipes defined.<br><br>

Heat embraces, as ovens hum,
Transforming raw batter into something yum.
The scent of vanilla fills the air,
Promising joy, beyond compare.<br><br>

From cookies to cakes, and pies so divine,
Baking brings comfort, in every line.
A taste of love, in every bite,
Baking captures moments, day or night.</p>
